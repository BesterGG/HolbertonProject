            <h2>The begining of everything</h2>

           <p> As a child, computers were something magical that few can understand. At the age of 6, I asked for my first computer for Christmas, and with effort my parents gave me the first big dream of my life.</p>

            <p>I didn't understand how they worked and it seemed all magic. My curiosity could not be sated with something that was so much bigger than anything my mind could imagine.</p>
                
            <p>The first thing I did with the computer was open paint and draw my family. Then I drew a cat, I still remember that moment. It was the beginning of the insatiable passion for computers.</p>

            <img class="paint" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/40/77/8b/40778b3e41fb7858621473ba17645f44.png" alt="Paint Windows XP">

            <hr>
                
            <p>Everything changed when the internet became normal in every home. My curiosity together with a computer with internet access made it grow without limits, being able to google anything and have thousands of pages answering my craziest questions in milliseconds.</p>
                
            <p>During my childhood my computer broke several times and I thought that those who knew how to repair them were super cool. A few years later, I decided that my future was related to computers. I studied computing in high school. I learned to repair them, but it was not enough to satisfy my ambitions.</p>
                
            <p>After learning how to repair them, I wanted to know how to control them. Give them orders and see how what was magic before was now something tangible.</p>
                
            <p>All the steps I took in my life were always surrounded by a computer and the internet. And that is precisely what led me to find Holberton and here I hope to be in May.</p>
