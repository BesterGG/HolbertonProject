            <h2>The beggining</h2>
            
            <p>It all started in 2015, I started playing hearthstone. In 2016 I started playing tournaments and in 2017 I won an important tournament in Uruguay and at the beginning of 2018 I retired to become an esports producer. This was the beginning of my entrepreneurship. I am the founder of <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/EKG_Esports">EKG Esports</a>. We are dedicated to organizing and producing esports & gaming events for Uruguay and Latin America.</p>

            <h3>Hearthstone Uruguay</h3>
            <p>We create activities and events for a united community</p>

            <h2>Blizzard Entertainment</h2>

            <p>When I became an esports producer, I had the opportunity to establish a relationship with the communication department of Blizzard Entertainment. Their community manager took me into account because I had experience organizing tournaments and I began to participate in the official Blizzard campaigns.</p>

            <h3>Gamecon 2018</h3>
            <p>At the end of 2018 there was a mega esports event in Uruguay. The most popular hardware companies sponsored him. I was hired to organize the hearthstone tournament. Also, since I had experience streaming, I was the main caster of the tournament.</p>

            <p>It was the biggest challenge, where I would put into practice everything I knew about management and organization.</p>
                
            <p>My first AAA event in the industry was a dream for me, especially since it was made in a basketball stadium
                (AAA is the gaming industry's equivalent of the word "blockbuster" that is used for the same category of products in the movie business) </p>

            <p>At Gamecon I understood that esports was an advertising business. Big investments for events are one of the many ways to get the attention of the public.</p>

                <img src="http://www.mayoristasymercado.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Unicom-Gamecon-2018_1.jpg" alt="Gamecon2018">

            <p>I studied marketing and advertising for one year to focus on my entrepreneurship. </p>
            <p><strong>In addition, I continue learning to manage groups and projects and organize them to work together.</strong> Each project is different and I have to adapt quickly to do my job</p>

            <h2>The future</h2>

            <img src="https://www.teahub.io/photos/full/21-217593_programming-background.jpg" alt="Code">

            <p>One of my dreams in the future is when I'm a professional developer. <strong> I would like to make a mobile application and a web page</strong> for the video gaming community in my country and gradually extend it to Latin America...and then, the world</p>
                    
            <p>I have many things in mind for this application, there are many things that today are not easy to do because there are no applications that solve them in an easy way. As an esports producer I understand the problems you have when doing tournaments. With the development knowledge <strong>I would like to create better solutions for this industry as a personal or professional project.</strong></p>
